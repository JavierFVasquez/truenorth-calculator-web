# TrueNorth Test

_TrueNorth Calculator Web - Frontend application_

## Getting Started 🚀

_In this project, I have developed a frontend application using Vite with React. It incorporates Redux for state management, Redux-Sagas for handling asynchronous logic, Axios for API communication, Styled-Components for styling, and React-Router-Dom for routing._

## Prerequisites 📋

- _You need to create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the environment variable for backend URL._

  ```
  VITE_BASE_API_URL="https://54t4g2pui3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
  ```

### Installation 🔧

_Follow these steps to install and run the project:_

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features ✨

- **React**: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: Redux is used for state management, providing a predictable and centralized store for managing application data.
- **Redux-Sagas**: Redux-Sagas is a middleware library that handles asynchronous logic, such as API calls and side effects, in a structured and manageable way.
- **Axios**: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the server and handling API communication.
- **Styled-Components**: Styled-Components is used for styling the components, allowing CSS to be written within the component code.
- **React-Router-Dom**: React-Router-Dom is used for handling routing and navigation within the application.
